            Once you add the ingredients, the lid is covered and sealed with dough and it is 
            slowly cooked with the trapped steam.</p>

        </ul>

        <h3 class= "steps">Steps:</h3>
        <ol class="list">
        <li>Place black peppercorns, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon sticks, star anise, 
            and kala jeera in a spice grinder; grind into a fine powder.</li>
        <li>Place cilantro and mint leaves in a food processor; pulse until coarsely chopped.
        </li>
        <li>Combine spice powder, cilantro-mint mixture, yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic
             paste, chile powder, biryani masala powder, and turmeric in a large bowl. 
             Add chicken; turn to coat evenly. Cover with plastic wrap and let marinate in 
             the refrigerator, about 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan; add 2 bay leaves. Reduce heat to
             medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is partially cooked through and still 
             firm, about 5 minutes. Drain.</li>
        <li>Combine milk and saffron in a small bowl; stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li>Heat ghee in a large pot with a tight-fitting lid over medium-high heat. 
            Add onions; cook and stir until golden brown, about 15 minutes. Drain on paper 
            towels. Reduce heat to low. Add remaining 2 bay leaves and chile peppers; cook 
            and stir until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Carefully remove 1 tablespoon of ghee 
            from the pot; set it aside.
        </li>
        <li>Wipe excess marinade off the chicken, discarding marinade, and add to the pot. 
            Cook over medium heat until no longer pink, about 2 minutes per side. Spread 
            drained rice on top. Sprinkle onions on top of the rice. Drizzle reserved ghee 
            and saffron milk over onions and rice.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and cook over high heat, about 8 minutes. Reduce heat to low and 
            continue cooking, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, 
            until rice is tender and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the chicken 
            reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 15 minutes.</li>
